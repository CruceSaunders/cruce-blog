I'm 17. And I'm building a company.

When I tell people this, I usually get one of two reactions:

1. "That's so inspiring!"
2. *Skeptical silence*

Both are valid. Here's what I've learned navigating both.

## The "Nobody Takes You Seriously" Advantage

Yes, it's harder to get meetings. Yes, people assume you don't know what you're doing. Yes, adults sometimes talk to you like you're a child.

But here's the flip side:

**Nobody expects you to succeed.**

That means you can experiment wildly. Fail loudly. Try stupid ideas. Nobody's watching closely enough to judge. The pressure of "reputation" doesn't exist yet.

By the time you're 25, every failure is a headline. At 17, it's just learning.

## Time is the Cheat Code

The math is simple: I have 50+ years of working life ahead of me. Most founders start at 30+. That gives me over a decade head start.

Even if Ippo fails completely, I'll have:
- Built a real product
- Learned Swift, Firebase, product design
- Shipped something to the App Store
- Failed in public (and survived)

That's worth more than any internship.

## School vs. Building

I go to Alpha High School — an AI-powered school focused on project-based learning. My afternoons are dedicated to building Ippo, not sitting in lectures.

Not everyone has this privilege. I know that.

But even with a traditional schedule, you can:
- Wake up an hour early to build
- Use weekends
- Skip the party occasionally

Time exists. It's about what you prioritize.

## What I'd Tell My 15-Year-Old Self

1. **Start before you're ready.** You'll never feel ready. Ship something ugly.

2. **Talk to users obsessively.** The best ideas come from conversations, not showers.

3. **Document everything.** I wish I'd started this blog sooner. Writing clarifies thinking.

4. **Find your people.** The internet makes it possible to find other young builders. DM them. Most will respond.

5. **Health first.** Building is a marathon. If your body breaks down, nothing else matters.

## The Real Lesson

Age is context, not capability.

Being young isn't a blocker. It's a buffer.

Use it.
