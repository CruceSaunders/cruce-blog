Most running apps suck.

Don't get me wrong — Strava, Nike Run Club, they're fine. They track your miles, show your pace, give you badges. But here's the thing: **they don't make running fun.** They just make tracking convenient.

I want to build something that makes running feel like a game. Something that makes you *want* to go out and run, not because you know you should, but because it's genuinely enjoyable.

## The Problem with Pace

Every running app is obsessed with pace. Faster is better. Always.

But here's what nobody talks about: a 10-minute mile for a beginner pushing their limits is *more impressive* than a 7-minute mile for an experienced runner jogging easy.

Effort matters. Pace doesn't tell the whole story.

## Enter Ippo

Ippo is effort-based, not pace-based. We measure how hard you're working relative to your own capacity. A beginner going all-out gets the same rewards as an elite runner cruising.

Here's what makes it different:

1. **Haptic-only chase encounters** — You'll feel enemies approaching through your Apple Watch. No need to stare at a screen.

2. **Pet collection** — Remember Tamagotchi? Imagine that, but for running. Collect pets, level them up, watch them grow.

3. **Variable ratio reinforcement** — The same psychology that makes slot machines addictive, but for something actually good for you.

## The Vision

I want people to get hooked on running the same way they get hooked on games.

Not because of guilt. Not because of fitness influencers. Because it's *fun*.

More updates coming soon. If you want to be an early tester, hit me up on Twitter.

Let's make running a game worth playing.
