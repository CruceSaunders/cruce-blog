Six months ago, I couldn't wake up before 8 AM without feeling like death.

Now I'm at the gym by 6:30 every morning. Not because I'm disciplined. Because I rebuilt my entire system around making it easy.

## The Old Me

Here's what my mornings used to look like:

- Wake up to alarm
- Hit snooze 3 times
- Scroll phone for 20 minutes
- Feel behind before the day even started

Sound familiar?

## The System That Changed Everything

I stopped relying on willpower. I engineered my environment instead.

### 1. Sleep Optimization

You can't win the morning if you lose the night before.

- Phone charges outside my room (not optional)
- Blackout curtains
- Same bedtime every night, even weekends
- No screens after 9 PM (this one's hard but worth it)

### 2. Morning Friction Removal

Everything I need is already set up the night before:

- Gym clothes laid out
- Bag packed
- Pre-workout mixed (just add water)
- Route to gym is automatic — I don't think, I just drive

### 3. The First 5 Minutes

The hardest part isn't the workout. It's the first 5 minutes of being awake.

My hack: I drink a full glass of cold water immediately. Something about the cold water tells my body "we're doing this."

## The Results

It's not just about fitness. Morning gym sessions gave me:

- **Better focus** — My brain is sharper until noon
- **More time** — Done with my workout before most people wake up
- **Confidence** — Starting the day with a win compounds
- **Consistency** — Haven't missed a day in 4 months

## The Workout Split

For those asking, here's my current split:

- **Monday**: Push (chest, shoulders, triceps)
- **Tuesday**: Pull (back, biceps)
- **Wednesday**: Legs
- **Thursday**: Push
- **Friday**: Pull
- **Saturday**: Legs or active recovery
- **Sunday**: Rest

Nothing fancy. Just consistency.

## Final Thought

The gym didn't change my life. **Building the system** that gets me to the gym changed my life.

Stop relying on motivation. Start building systems.
